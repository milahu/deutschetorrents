Hello,

Thanks a lot for this repos, I think what you're doing do more for the
German language than you think.

My children are French-German bilinguals in France and streamkiste (now
down) was a possibility for them to watch some movies in German.

A target is Disneys, Myiazaki, good children (&lt;7) movies?

There is this impressive popular French magnet with all Disneys for
instance, but it doesn't help German practice…

Any opinion?

Thanks.

Best,

Estébastien

(Dalmatiner, Bambi, Cup und Capper, Cinderella, Peter Pan and Snow White
are findable). A preference could be Dumbo, Merlin, Robin Hood, Ariel,
...

yay robin hood ^^

search for "[disney
multi](https://solidtorrents.to/search?q=disney+multi&sort=size)"
torrents  
for example "the simpsons multi"  
has many languages including german  
so a lot less work for me ^^

yeah, these services come and go  
see also [tarnkappe.info](https://tarnkappe.info/listen)

its always frustrating to deal with these people  
as they have this deep fear of bittorrent  
since torrent.to was busted some years ago  
because it was a for-profit operation  
but bittorrent seeding is legal in germany  
as long as it is non-profit

> these services come and go

bittorrent would solve this issue  
by decentralization  
but some people are stuck on http, ftp, nntp
